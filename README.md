# Machine learning homework
1. Supervised learning algorithms:
Support vector machine (SVM.py), 
k-nearest neighbors (K-nn.py), 
Decision tree (Decision_tree.py), Boosting (Boosting.py), 
Neural networks (MLP.py, MLP-learning-curve.py). 
MLP-learning-curve.py is used to plot learning-curve for MLP. 
util.py: plot functions for learning curve and confusion matrix for other 4 algorithms.

2. Unsupervised learning algorithms:
 K-means.py (k-means clustering with all features, PCA, ICA, Randomized projection, TSNE)
 Gaussin-mixture.py (expectation maximization with all features, PCA, ICA, Randomized projection, TSNE)
